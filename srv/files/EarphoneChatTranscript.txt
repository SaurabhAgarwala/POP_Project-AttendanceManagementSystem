Mohammed: 
Hello, my name is Mohammed. I'll certainly try to help regarding your concern. 
Are we connected ? 
Me: 
I purchased an bluetooth earphone from Amazon about 6 months ago.... 
Mohammed: 
Yes 
Me: 
But a few days before the earphone got defective.....but as it was in warranty period which was of 1 year....I contacted the company concerned.... 
Mohammed: 
I understand your concern that the product is not working. 
Me: 
There they told me that the product was never authorised to be sold in India and hence they can't cover it in the warranty.... 
Mohammed: 
Need not worry I will help you with that. 
TaoTronics BH06 Sweatproof Bluetooth In-Ear Headphones with Mic - Black 
This is the product are you referring to? 
Me: 
yups 
Mohammed: 
Thank you so much for confirming the details. 
Me: 
I even have a mail from the TaoTronics team..... 
specifying the things I mentioned above... 
Mohammed: 
Saurabh, In this case you need to contact manufacturer to claim the warranty and of they deny to help you please ask them to provide service denial letter. 
Me: 
They have already provided with a service denial mail... 
they told me to contact the reseller for troubleshoot... 
Mohammed: 
Please help us with the same mail through registered mail id. 
Me: 
If you want I can share the mail I received from them... 
In which mail ID should I send it? 
Mohammed: 
Because after return window expires you need to contact manufacturer because the product will get made from them and just it sold in Amazon. 
"cs-reply@amazon.in" using the Email address that you have registered with us. 
Me: 
I have send the mail... 
Mohammed: 
Thank you 
Let me check. 
Me: 
I understand the point of return window pointed out by you... 
But in the mail they have written that they don't sell their products on Indian sites... 
Mohammed: 
Okay 
Me: 
But I purchased it from Amazon, which means the reseller went against the law...to sell a product which was not authorised for the country.. 
Mohammed: 
Let me check Saurabh, Please allow me a moment. 
Me: 
And hence I have been denied service from the company... 
Yaa sure..,. 
Mohammed: 
"cs-reply@amazon.in" using the Email address that you have registered with us
